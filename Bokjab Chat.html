    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>Bokjab Chat was one of the last final projects I did during college. 
        <br>The goal was to create an Android application that allowed you to send friend requests 
        <br>and chat with others that were using the same app. 
        <br>Additionally, our professor requested that we have a page dedicated, dynamic weather page. 
        <br>We designed the whole front end with Android Studio (majority Java, some xml), used mainly 
        <br>JavaScript, and a bit of HTML and SQL with our backend. 
        <br>Finally, we used Heroku as our connecting cloud service.</p>
    
    <h3>Contributions:</h3>

    <p>While I was not the main one assigned to it, I did help with the sign in process we implemented. 
        <br>I helped figure out how to retrieve input from the user and checking the credentials.</p>

    <p>My focus of this project was to figure all the ins and outs of the weather portion of the app. 
        <br>I was able to achieve this by using OpenWeatherMap’s Weather API. 
        <br>By making a request with the API, you can achieve several different types of weather forecasts 
        <br>for a desired area (we made use of the 5-day and 24-hour requests).<br></p>

    <p>The app will automatically request you turn location services on, and by doing this it will show your 
        <br>locations current weather. If you decline, we checked with the professor, and we all decided that it will 
        <br>default to Seattle. You can also change the location by typing in a new zip code.<br></p>

    <p>In the middle is a recycler viewer. Which allows you to scroll and view the current 24-hour forecast. Above and below 
        <br>are standard image and text views, which will also adjust according to the current location’s weather.</p>

    <p>Lastly, the home page will also display weather information. This is determined by your default location, then your last searched location.</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Bokjab Chat was one of the last final projects I did during college. 
        The goal was to create an Android application that allowed you to send friend requests and chat with others that were using the same app. 
        <br>our professor requested that we have a page dedicated, dynamic weather page. 
        <br>We designed the whole front end with Android Studio (majority Java, some xml), used mainly JavaScript, and a bit of HTML and SQL with our backend. 
        <br>Finally, we used Heroku as our connecting cloud service.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Bokjab Chat was one of the last final projects I did during college. 
        The goal was to create an Android application that allowed you to send friend requests and chat with others that were using the same app. 
        Additionally, our professor requested that we have a page dedicated, dynamic weather page. 
        We designed the whole front end with Android Studio (majority Java, some xml), used mainly JavaScript, and a bit of HTML and SQL with our backend. 
        Finally, we used Heroku as our connecting cloud service.</p>
